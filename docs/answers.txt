Inheritance lets a class inherit properties and behaviors from another class, enabling code reuse.

Polymorphism allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object, through method overloading or overriding

Encapsulation restricts access to an object's data by bundling data and methods together and controlling visibility with access modifiers.

9. The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow uses a hierarchy where lieutenants review and merge contributions before the lead developer (dictator) gives final approval. In contrast, the Integration Manager workflow has one person merging all changes without intermediaries

10. Dictator and Lieutenants workflow reduces bottlenecks by allowing lieutenants to manage merges. Adds quality control with an extra review layer. Keeps organization clear, which is ideal for large teams.
